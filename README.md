# Snowflake Dashboard

## Introduction

This repository contains the new version of the Snowflake Dashboard. This version is still a **work-in-progress** and **is not live yet**.

## Rules and convention

In order to keep the maintainability of the code, it is mandatory to respect the rules chosen for this project:

- Airbnb Javascript styleguide
- BEM naming convention

Plugins such as ESLint or Stylelint can be installed in your IDE to help you out with these rules.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped using `create-react-app`, all of the scripts are still available. However, we recommend you to use only the two following:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
